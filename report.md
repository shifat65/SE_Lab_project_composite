# CSE 3206 Project Report: Composite Design Pattern

## Chosen Design Pattern: Composite

The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### Key Components:
1. **Component**: The abstract base class that declares the interface for objects in the composition.
2. **Leaf**: Represents leaf objects in the composition that have no children.
3. **Composite**: Defines behavior for components having children and stores child components.

### Program Structure:
- The `Component` class provides default implementations for child management operations.
- `Leaf` implements the `Component` interface and represents end objects.
- `Composite` implements child-related operations and stores child components.
- Both `Leaf` and `Composite` implement the `operation()` method, allowing uniform treatment.

### Testing Approach:
1. **Leaf Operation Test**: Verifies that a leaf performs its operation correctly.
2. **Empty Composite Test**: Ensures a composite with no children works properly.
3. **Composite with Children Test**: Checks that a composite correctly delegates to its children.
4. **Nested Composite Test**: Verifies proper operation with nested composites.
5. **Add/Remove Test**: Confirms child management operations work correctly.
6. **Leaf Constraints Test**: Ensures leaves can't have children.

### Benefits of Composite Pattern:
- Simplifies client code by treating individual and composite objects uniformly.
- Makes it easy to add new kinds of components.
- Provides flexibility of structure with a manageable interface.

### Example Use Cases:
- GUI components (windows containing panels containing buttons)
- File system representations (directories containing files or other directories)
- Organizational structures (departments containing employees or sub-departments)
